        <h1>The Importance of Maintaining Good Health</h1>
    </header>
    <article>
        <p>Good health is the foundation of a happy and fulfilling life. It enables us to perform daily activities with energy and enthusiasm, and it helps prevent a wide range of diseases and health conditions.</p>
        <h2>Healthy Eating</h2>
        <p>Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins provides the essential nutrients our bodies need. Avoiding excessive sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats can reduce the risk of chronic illnesses such as heart disease and diabetes.</p>
        <h2>Regular Exercise</h2>
        <p>Physical activity strengthens the heart, muscles, and bones, improves mental health, and boosts the immune system. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week, such as walking, cycling, or swimming.</p>
        <h2>Mental Well-being</h2>
        <p>Mental health is just as important as physical health. Practices such as mindfulness, meditation, and maintaining social connections can help reduce stress and improve overall well-being.</p>
        <h2>Regular Check-ups</h2>
        <p>Visiting healthcare professionals for regular check-ups and screenings can help detect potential health issues early, making treatment more effective.</p>
        <h2>Quality Sleep</h2>
        <p>Getting enough restful sleep is crucial for physical and mental health. Adults should aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night to support cognitive function, mood regulation, and overall wellness.</p>
        <h2>Hydration</h2>
        <p>Drinking enough water throughout the day helps maintain bodily functions, supports digestion, and keeps skin healthy. Aim for at least 8 glasses of water daily, adjusting for activity level and climate.</p>
        <h2>Stress Management</h2>
        <p>Chronic stress can negatively impact health. Techniques such as deep breathing, yoga, and spending time in nature can help manage stress and promote relaxation.</p>
